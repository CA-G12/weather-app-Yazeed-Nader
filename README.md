- CSS ➙ It is used to describes how elements should be rendered on screen and the styling of the app pages
- JavaScript ➙ It is used to gives the app interactive elements that engage a user
- API ➙ It used for communicate with other products and services without having to know how they’re implemented
- Node JS ➙ primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind
- npm ➙ is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently.
